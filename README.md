#### Installation

I have only detailed the Ubuntu installation procedure, but I don't think it
should be very hard to setup on OS X, macports should have you covered.

1. Install Python Development Tools
$ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev
1. Install [MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)
1. Traverse to projectTweet.crawler
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
